/**
 * To direct from a page to another page, we need a line that builds a route first 
 * before using regular html/ejs redirecting codes under '.ejs' files.
 * EX:
 *    1) A line that builds a route for 'playerEntry':
 *      - '.get('/playerEntry', (req, res) => res.render('pages/playerEntry'))'
 * 
 *       ** this line of code would make the playerEntry web be named: 
 *          "https://team-11-app.herokuapp.com/playerEntry"
 *       ** similar, since we did not specify a specific name for the splash screen as  
 *          the program starts, the initial app web would be (for 3 seconds):
 *          "https://team-11-app.herokuapp.com"
 *          
 * 
 *    2) Under 'splash.ejs,' add in the line that redirects to 'player.ejs.'
 *       Since we are redirectly automatically after 3 seconds, we use: 
 *      - '<meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "3; url = https://team-11-app.herokuapp.com/playerEntry" />'
